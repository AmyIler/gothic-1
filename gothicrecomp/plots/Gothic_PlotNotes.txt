Notes on plot names
31.March.2011
---------------------------
---------------------------
gothiccleanplots.R does the work to pre-clean the plots
I then ran the output and decisions I made by George Aldridge (Inouye postdoc) 

---------------------------
Updated 9.Sept.2015: To change:
wm: willow-meadow 
mi: interface plots
to now all be part of interface plots
Also changed gothiccleanplots.R to fix the cause of the problem and lookupplotcorr.csv, updated the metadata file and recompiled the data to incorporate this change.
---------------------------

Plot naming:
rm: rocky meadow
gh: greenhouse
vr: veratrum removal
wm: wet meadow
em: erthronium meados
mw: meadow (alone) plots
st stream plots
mi: interface plots and willow-meadow interface plots

Other changes:
numbers 10 and 11 -- to 1 (st1 and st10 are the same plot)
1973 plots were left unchanged on purpose (first year, naming conventions and plots in flux)
